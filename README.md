# highball-engine

The Wine engine build for [Highball](https://github.com/gauthierpiarrette/highball), as a
reproducible recipe: pinned upstream sources, a small patch series, and a CI workflow that turns
them into an engine tarball the app can install.

## Status

In use. Highball ships this build as its opt-in Wine 11 engine (the `x64-crossover26.3-r*`
revisions in the app's engine manifests), next to the default Sikarugir Wine 10 engine. The
launchers that need Wine 11 (the EA app among them) and the games whose fixes only exist here
(The Last Flame, ContractVille) have their recipes name it, and the app offers it on Play. It
never replaces an environment's engine without the user asking.

## Experimental proposals

The [AoE IV Rosetta proposal](proposals/aoe4/README.md) is an opt-in source port with pinned
inputs and portable tests. It is outside the default patch series and still needs a macOS/game
trial before adoption.

## What it builds from

- **Wine:** CodeWeavers' CrossOver Wine sources, published under the LGPL with each CrossOver
  release. The exact tarball, its size and SHA-256 are pinned in [`inputs.json`](inputs.json).
  This is the tree that currently fixes things the upstream-derived builds cannot (the Rockstar
  installer's service start, for one), and it is the only public source of a current macOS-capable
  Wine.
- **Patches:** the series in [`patches/`](patches/), applied in order. Kept as small as possible,
  each one sent upstream the day it is verified, and dropped the day upstream ships it.
- **Components** the engine bundles or expects: MoltenVK (Apache 2.0), DXVK (zlib), DXMT (see its
  licence), winetricks (LGPL). D3DMetal is never included; Highball gates it behind Apple's licence
  at install time.

## Provenance and credit

- CodeWeavers, for CrossOver and for publishing its sources.
- Gcenx, whose Sikarugir engine Highball has shipped on since its first release.
- frankea, whose [winecx-gptk](https://github.com/frankea/winecx-gptk) workflow showed that a
  clean-room CI build of the CrossOver tree on hosted macOS runners is practical; the workflow
  here is written independently but follows the same shape (pinned inputs, nix-free where
  possible, mingw-w64 for the PE half, ccache).
- The DXMT, DXVK and MoltenVK authors.

## Licensing

Wine and the patches to it are LGPL-2.1-or-later; see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Every release of an
engine built here carries the corresponding source: the pinned tarball and the patch series at the
tagged commit. [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) lists the bundled components and their licences. "CrossOver"
is a trademark of CodeWeavers; this is not CrossOver, it is a build from CrossOver's published
LGPL sources.

## Bugs

A game that misbehaves on an engine built here is a bug for this repository or for Highball, not
for CodeWeavers, Sikarugir or WineHQ. Reports there about a patched build waste their time and
are unwelcome by their own policies.

## Build notes

- The Unix side is built as x86_64 on an Intel runner (`macos-15-intel`). The CrossOver tree guards its Metal layer class with `#if defined(__x86_64__)`, and the Mac driver uses it unconditionally, so an arm64 host compile fails in `cocoa_window.m`. CrossOver and Sikarugir ship x86_64 Unix libraries that run under Rosetta.
- `--with-opengl` must not be passed: configure makes the missing EGL headers a hard error when OpenGL is requested explicitly, and macOS has no EGL. Without the flag the Mac driver links OpenGL.framework.
- MoltenVK must be present at build time (`brew install molten-vk`): configure defines the Vulkan library name from `-lMoltenVK`, and the tree's win32u uses that name unguarded, so without it the compile fails in `dlls/win32u/vulkan.c`. The engine still ships its own libMoltenVK at runtime.
- Wine Mono and Gecko are unpacked into `share/wine/mono` and `share/wine/gecko` at the versions the tree names in `dlls/appwiz.cpl/addons.c`. Without them a bottle's first boot stops at Wine's "download Mono?" prompt, which no unattended run can answer.
- The tree's CrossOver hack that names the Windows user "crossover" is reverted by the first patch in the series, so bottles keep `C:\users\<macOS user>` like on the Sikarugir engines.

## Releases

A dispatch with `publish_release=true` creates a GitHub release tagged after the artifact (`engine-wine-<version>-<date>-<note>`) with the tarball and its `.sha256`. Highball's engine manifest (`spike/engines/<id>.json` in the app repository) names the tarball's URL, size and checksum, and extracts its `engine/` subtree; the app never builds anything itself. Current: `engine-wine-11.0-20260904T153322Z-winemetal`, with Wine Mono and Gecko included, patches 0001 to 0003 applied (real user name, OpenGL-first wined3d, WINEDLLPATH_PREPEND) and winemetal.dll shipped as a built-in so DXMT's overlay loads in a fresh prefix.
- DXMT's `winemetal.dll` is copied into the engine's built-in directories so a prefix carries its placeholder; without it Wine refuses to load the overlay's copy for DXMT's dxgi (found 2026-09-04).

## Status (2026-09-04)

The build runs Wine 11 programs, and DXVK games launched from Steam render on it. It is not
bundled in Highball yet because Steam's browser under DXMT asks for a swapchain on a window owned
by another process, which public DXMT refuses; with the browser kept off the GPU
(`-cef-disable-gpu`) Steam's window stays black and a game launched through that client never
starts. The fix is a driver change (a Cocoa overlay window for foreign client surfaces in
winemac.drv, and DXMT reading the layer through it) or a DXMT change CodeWeavers has not
published. Highball issue #56 tracks the question of Wine 11 support.

- `0005-ntdll-yield-after-auto-event-set.patch`: after an auto-reset event goes 0→1 (msync) or the server reports a 0→1 set (sync=none), yield once so the woken waiter runs before the setter can signal again. Windows boosts the woken thread; without it a job hand-off that signals twice loses the second wake-up (CS:GO legacy's map-load freeze on macOS 26 under Rosetta, reproduced 2026-09-04).
- `0006-kernelbase-per-exe-command-line-append.patch`: `HKCU\Software\Wine\AppDefaults\<exe>\CommandLineAppend` (REG_SZ) is appended to that executable's command line at CreateProcess. Data-driven per-app switches for programs that never forward them to their subprocesses (a launcher's CEF browser: --log-severity, --log-file, GPU switches). Proton keeps a hard-coded table for the same purpose.
- `0007-winemac-cross-process-child-swapchains.patch`: implements Wine bug 60263 — a CEF GPU process (Rockstar/Ubisoft/Steam browser) presenting into a child window whose root belongs to another process gets a CAContext-exported offscreen Metal swapchain, hosted in the owning process via CALayerHost (WM_MACDRV_CREATE_REMOTE_LAYER). Supersedes the old 0004 overlay approach. Fixes the blank CEF sign-in / black Steam client.
